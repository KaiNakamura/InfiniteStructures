## About

This project is a spigot plugin that allows you to generate infinite structures in your minecraft world.

## Installation

Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/KaiNakamura/InfiniteStructures/releases) and place the JAR file in the plugins folder of your server.

## Setup

To start generating infinite structures, load the plugin and navigate to the [config.yml](https://github.com/KaiNakamura/InfiniteStructures/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml) file in the plugins folder of your server under `InfiniteStructures\config.yml`

This plugin allows you to change the following structures:
* Village
* Desert Pyramid
* Igloo
* Jungle Pyramid
* Swamp Hut
* Pillager Outpost
* Monument
* Endcity
* Mansion
* Ruined Portal
* Shipwreck
* Ocean Ruin
* Bastion Remnant
* Fortress
* Nether Fossil

Each structure has the following configuration options:

| Option | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spacing` | Average distance between two structure placement attempts of this type in chunks | |
| `separation` | Minimum distance between two structures of this type in chunks | MUST be less than `spacing` |
| `salt` | A number that assists in randomization | See [salt (cryptography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) |

Leaving a number blank will set it to its default value. To infinitely repeat a structure, use `2` for `spacing` and `1` for `separation`. For more details see the [minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Custom#Generator_types).

Changes take effect upon generating a world. To reset the world delete the `world`, `world_nether`, and `world_the_end` folders of your server.
